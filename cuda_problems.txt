It means you miss any installation step or it didnt add to your PATH.

check if it is in your PATH by whereis nvcc, if it returns nvcc: then you need to add below two lines in .bashrc
usually .bashrc file path is like /home/username/.bashrc then add below two lines (change cuda version with installed version)
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.4/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.4/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
then save and close the file
check nvcc --version
